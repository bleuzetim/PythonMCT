        <p>
            Spotify provides a Top Tracks listing, which monitors what people are listening to within Spotify - think of it as an alternative to the Billboard Hot 100. The popularity bar that appears next to all Spotify tracks is a meter that measures how frequently a track is being listened to - the more people are listening to it, the higher the meter goes.
